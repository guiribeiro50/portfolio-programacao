# Programming Portfolio
This repository showcases a selection of projects I have developed throughout my academic journey as a Computer Engineering student at Universidade Portucalense, as well as projects completed during the Piscine at 42 Porto.
It reflects my growth as a programmer, covering different areas such as algorithms, data structures, problem-solving, and software development. Each project highlights specific skills and technologies I have worked with, serving both as a record of my learning process and as a demonstration of my ability to adapt to different programming challenges.
