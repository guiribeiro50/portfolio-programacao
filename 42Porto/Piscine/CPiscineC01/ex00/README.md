# Exercise 00

## Description

This exercise consists of creating a function that takes a pointer to int as a parameter and sets the value "42" to that int.

## Objective

Create a function that:
- Takes a pointer to int as parameter
- Sets the value 42 to the integer pointed to by the pointer
- Uses no external functions

## Implementation Instructions

1. **Create the function** with the specified prototype

2. **Set the value 42** to the integer through the pointer

3. **Compile and test** with:
   ```bash
   cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror
   ```

## Expected Result

The function should modify the value of the integer pointed to by the parameter, setting it to 42.

## Delivery

The file must contain the function implementation.

## Technical Notes

- No external functions are allowed
- The function works with pointer dereferencing
- The original integer value will be modified to 42
- Handle the pointer parameter correctly
