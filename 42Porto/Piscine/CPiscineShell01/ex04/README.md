# Exercise 04

## Description

This exercise consists of writing a command line that displays the machine's MAC addresses.

## Objective

Create a command that:
- Displays all MAC addresses of the machine
- Each address must be followed by a line break
- Works independently of the operating system

## Implementation Instructions

1. **Write the command** that obtains the MAC addresses

2. **Format the output** with a line break after each address

3. **Test** the command on the machine

## Expected Result

The output should display MAC addresses, one per line:
```
aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff
11:22:33:44:55:66
```

## Delivery

The file must be present in the repository containing the correct command.

## Technical Notes

- The command must work on Unix/Linux systems
- Each MAC address must appear on a separate line
- All available MAC addresses on the machine should be displayed
- The address format may vary according to the system
