# Exercise 01

## Description

This exercise consists of creating a function that displays the lowercase alphabet in ascending order on a single line.

## Objective

Create a function called `ft_print_alphabet` that:
- Displays the alphabet in lowercase
- Shows all letters on a single line
- Displays in ascending order starting from 'a'
- Uses only the write function

## Implementation Instructions

1. **Create the function** with the prototype:
   ```c
   void ft_print_alphabet(void);
   ```

2. **Display letters from 'a' to 'z'** in ascending order

3. **Use only the write function** for output

4. **Compile and test** with:
   ```bash
   cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror
   ```

## Expected Result

The function should display:
```
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```

## Delivery

The file must contain the `ft_print_alphabet` function implementation.

## Technical Notes

- Only the write function is allowed
- All letters must be displayed on a single line
- The output must be in lowercase
- The order must be ascending from 'a' to 'z'
